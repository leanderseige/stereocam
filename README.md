# DIY Stereo Camera

A quick Sunday project: build a quick and easy stereo camera. You get two mobile devices: VR glasses and a mobile stereo camera, connected to each other.

## Material
- a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian (I used Model 4 / 4GB plus an additional Fan)
- two cheap USB webcams
- an old box
- a Powerbank
- one of those cheap plastic VR head mount frames for your phone

Build it all together:

## Install necessary Software

```
sudo apt-get install python python-opencv python-flask build-essential libssl-dev
```

## Run it

Clone this repo

```
git@github.com:leanderseige/stereocam.git
```
and run the server
```
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```
Now check with your browser and your phone's browser (should be on the same WLAN).

Carefully adjust the cameras. This will have great impact on how good it works!

Put the phone in the VR frame and enjoy!

## Possible Improvements:
- fullscreen mode must be adjusted for Apple phones
- configure QoS on your network to avoid dropping frames
- open wifi AP on your phone and connect to Raspberry Pi to it, so they have an exclusive network and all the bandwidth.
- switch from flask and jpeg to a separate h.264 stream somehow (ffserver?)
- ...
